# Dragon-ball-allies - - - - Ver 0.5
M.u.g.e.n inspired on Dragon Ball advanced adventure game.
The game is in its starting version and everytime time i add a new character, the version number will increase by 1.
The characters are choosen based on how much animations they have from the original 3ds game and i'm not putting fan versions based on the style (like android 21 one (unless she has good ammount of anims). 
### ALL the characters were originally edited by malusardimugen and mikel8888, everything else, advanced.cns, teleport.cns, effects.cns and etc are made and edited by me.
If you want to play the actual version at moment, download at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AcRcO0u5rAfMiniNLpmcT69_90Li5RrH/view?usp=drive_link
